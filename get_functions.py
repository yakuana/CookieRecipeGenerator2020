Description: This file holds three functions. get_probability() generates and return a new recipe object based on the best of a given set. get_top_fitness() returns the top three recipes in a given list based on its fitness. Both methods are useful for generating the new recipes and new generations in the main.py file. pivot_ingredients() Returns the combination of two lists after they have each been split by a random pivot
